# React Data Display App

## Overview

This React application fetches data from a specified API and displays it in an organized manner. The app intelligently differentiates between table data and key-value pair data, presenting them in visually appealing formats.

## Features

- Fetches data from a RESTful API.
- Displays table data in a neatly aligned table format.
- Generates cards for key-value pair data, showcasing the information clearly.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Axios (for API calls)
- CSS (or any styling framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI)
- (Optional) React Router (if your app includes navigation)

Usage
Fetching Data: The app makes a GET request to the specified API endpoint to fetch data. You can customize the endpoint in the source code.

Data Display:

Table Data: If the fetched data is in a tabular format, it will be displayed using a responsive table.
Key-Value Pair Data: If the data consists of key-value pairs, it will be showcased in cards for better visibility.

Customization
API Endpoint: Update the endpoint in the src/api.js file to point to your desired data source.
Styling: Modify the CSS files or integrate a CSS framework to customize the design according to your needs.
